# Cultural Arts Scene Comparison

A small tour-guide company that focuses on museums and cultural arts centers is looking to expand by opening a new office in a new city somewhere in the US or Western Europe. From a short list of preferred locations, the company has tasked us to determine in which city is the most appropriate to expand.

Specifically, the company would like to know which metropolis has (i) the most museums and cultural arts centers, and (ii) the highest concentration of museums and where they are located.
