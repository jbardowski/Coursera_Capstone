# A Comparison of Museums and Cultural Arts Scenes Between Metropolises


**Define the problem**

A small tour-guide company that focuses on museums, historical sites, and the cultural and performing arts is looking to expand by opening a new office in a new city somewhere in the US or Western Europe. From a short list of preferred locations, the company has tasked us to determine in which city is the most appropriate to open an office.

Specifically, between four pre-selected cities (New York, Paris, London, and Toronto), the company would like to know which metropolis has ***(i)*** the highest number of museums, arts centers, and historic sites, ***(ii)*** the highest concentration of museums, as well as in which neighborhoods they are located, and ***(iii)*** a comparison of the surrounding neighborhoods (i.e., what venues are around the museums).


**Describe the data**

To facilitate the clientâ€™s request, we leverage data from ***(a)*** Wikipedia, which we scrape to *[i]* find the neighborhood names and addresses for Paris ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris)), London ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London)), and Toronto ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M)), and *[ii]* find the total area for each city that we used to scale our dataset ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities)), ***(b)*** a local JSON file downloaded from Coursera for the neighborhood names and addresses in New York, and ***(c)*** FourSquare's API to search for and download venues in each city's neighborhoods.
